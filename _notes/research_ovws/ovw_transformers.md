      - PPLs extend probabilistic graphical models to support more complex joint distributions whose size and ‚Äúshape‚Äù can itself be stochastic
        - e.g., a graph unrolled for a random number of iterations, until a data-dependent stopping criterion is met

## transformer circuits

[thread](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) (elhage...olah, 2021)

- all layers are same dimension and each attention block **adds** a vector to it
- Although they‚Äôre parameterized as separate matrices, $W_O W_V$ and $W_Q^T W_K$ can always be thought of as individual, low-rank matrices
  - $x \in \mathbb R^{d_{embed} \times d_{sequence}}$: $d_{embed}$ can be hundreds - tens of thousands 
  - $W_Q, W_K, W_V \in \mathbb R^{d_{attn} \times d_{embed}}$
    - $W_Q^TW_k \in \mathbb R ^{d_{embed} \times d_{embed}}$
  - $W_O \in \mathbb R^{d_{embed} \times d_{attn}}$: projects attention values back to embedding dimention
    - $W_O W_V \in \mathbb R ^{d_{embed} \times d_{embed}}$
  - $W_E \in \mathbb R^{d_{embed} \times d_{vocab}}$ embeds initial tokens and $W_U \in \mathbb R^{d_{vocab} \times d_{embed}}$ undoes the embedding
    - $d_{vocab}$ can be very large, e.g. 50k
  - $A = \text{softmax}(x^TW_Q^TW_kx) \in \mathbb R^{d_{sequence} \times d_{sequence}}$
- if we have a 0-layer net (e.g. predict next token with linear layer given current token), we just learn bigram log-likelihood
- 2 circuits
  - QK circuit determines which "source" token the present "destination" token attends back to and copies information from
    - $W_{E}^{T} W_{Q}^{T} W_{K} W_{E} \in \mathbb R ^{d_{vocab} \times d_{vocab}}$
  - OV circuit describes what the resulting effect on the "out" predictions for the next token is
    - $W_{U} W_{O} W_{V} W_{E} \in \mathbb R ^{d_{vocab} \times d_{vocab}}$
- if a single head increases the probability of both `keep‚Ä¶ in mind` and `keep‚Ä¶ at bay`, it *must* also increase the probability of `keep‚Ä¶ in bay` and `keep‚Ä¶ at mind`
- **induction heads** search previous examples of present token
  - If they don't find it, they attend to the first token and do nothing
  - if they do find it, they then look at the *next* token and copy it. This allows them to repeat previous sequences of tokens, both exactly and approximately
  - sometimes can do some kind of "fuzzy" matching
- tensor/kronecker product $\bigotimes$:
  - Left-right multiplying: Multiplying $x$ by a tensor product $A \otimes W$ is equivalent to simultaneously left and right multiplying: $(A \otimes W) x=A x W^{T}$
  - When we add them, it is equivalent to adding the results of this multiplication: $\left(A_{1} \otimes W_{1}+A_{2} \otimes W_{2}\right) x=A_{1} x W_{1}^{T}+A_{2} x W_{2}^{T}$ 

## mixture of experts (MoE)

- non-specialized experts
  - Early versions ([Jacobs et al., 1991](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6797059)) had independent feed-forward networks serving as experts
  - Recent MoE models ([Shazeer et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538)) have been studied with token-based routing with backprop
  - GShard [Lepikhin et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16668), which appplies this concept to machine translation
  - Switch transformers [Fedus et al. (2022)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0998/21-0998.pdf) simplifies the architecture to activation of only one expert per layer
  - Base Layers [Lewis et al. (2021)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/lewis21a.html) - find an alternative approach to routing by formulating it as a linear assignment problem
  - Hash layers [Roller et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04426) use a fixed hash as the gating function
- specialized experts
  - DEmix Layers [Gururangan et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05036) (2022) --  DEMix layers ‚Äì placed in the feedforward layers of the Transformer ‚Äì contain experts which specialize on specific domains. Routing at train time is determined only by the domain label, but all experts are activated at inference time and mixed according to weights estimated from a validation set
  - [Pfeiffer et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06266) - multilingual expert model with language-specific routing
  - task-level MoE [Kudugunta et al. (2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03742)) -- multi-task expert model with task-specific routing
  - ELMS -- Branch-Train-Merge ([li et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03306))
    - parallel language model of smaller expert LMs
    - each  can be added/removed, ensembled, or parameter-averaged at any time for efficient scaling and rapid customization
    - improves perplexities, when controlling for training cost
      - require expert domain specialization
- adapter - between finetuning all layers, and just finetuning a new layer
  - add some new layers and retrain some specific things (all human choices)

# basics

- **attention** = vector of importance weights
  - to predict or infer one element, such as a pixel in an image or a word in a sentence, we estimate using the attention vector how strongly it is correlated with (or ‚Äú*attends to*‚Äù other elements and take the sum of their values weighted by the attention vector as the approximation of the target

- vanilla transformer: multihead attention, add + norm, position-wise ffn, add + norm
- self-attention layer [implementation](https://github.com/mertensu/transformer-tutorial) and [mathematics](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/docs/transformers.pdf)

## mathematical overview of transformers ([Formal Algorithms for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email))

- tasks
  - *sequence modeling*: learn $p(x)$, usually factorized as $p(x_i|x_1,...,x_{i-1})$
  - *sequence-to-sequence*: learn $p(z|x)$, e.g. transalation, speech-to-text, question answering
- preprocessing
  - embedding matrix takes in one-hot tokens and linearly maps them to a vector
  - positional embedding of a token is usually added to the token embedding to form a token‚Äôs initial embedding
- attention types
  - *Bidirectional / unmasked self-attention* - primary/context vectors are the same
  - *Unidirectional / masked self-attention* - mask scores from before a given word
  - *Cross-attention* - primary/context vectors can come from different places
- non-attention
  - layernorm: controls mean/variance of activations
    - RMSnorm: simpler version, sets mean/offset to zero
- unembedding
  - linear layer (with softmax) that outputs size of original vocab
    - sometimes fixed to be transpose of the embedding matrix
- architectures
  - initially, encoder-decoder was common, but now often no decoder

## visual explanation (notes on article by jay allamar)

- **self-attention ** - layer that lets word learn its relation to other layers
  - for each word, want score telling how much importance to place on each other word (queries $\cdot$ keys)
  - we get an encoding for each word
    - the encoding of each word returns a weighted sum of the values of the words (the current word gets the highest weight)
    - softmax this and use it to do weighted sum of values![Screen Shot 2019-08-17 at 2.51.53 PM](../assets/attention.png)
  - (optional) implementation details
    - **multi-headed attention** - just like having many filters, get many encodings for each word
      - each one can take input as the embedding from the previous attention layer
    - **position vector** - add this into the embedding of each word (so words know how far apart they are) - usually use sin/cos rather than actual position number
    - **padding mask** - add zeros to the end of the sequence
    - **look-ahead mask** - might want to mask to only use previous words (e.g. if our final task is decoding)
    - **residual + normalize** - after self-attention layer, often have residual connection to previous input, which gets added then normalized
  - decoder - each word only allowed to attend to previous positions
  - 3 components
    - queries
    - keys
    - values
- **attention**
  - encoder reads input and ouputs context vector after each word
  - decoder at each step uses a different weighted combination of these context vectors
    - specifically, at each step, decoder concatenates its hidden state w/ the attention vector (the weighted combination of the context vectors)
    - this is fed to a feedforward net to output a word
    - ![Screen Shot 2019-04-11 at 7.57.14 PM](../assets/nmt.png)
  - at a high level we have $Q, K, V$ and compute $softmax(QK^T)V$
    - instead could simplify it and do $softmax(XX^T)V$ - this would then be based on kernel
- **transformer**
  - uses many self-attention layers
  - many stacked layers in encoder + decoder (not rnn: self-attention + feed forward)
  - details
    - initial encoding: each word -> vector
    - each layer takes a list of fixed size (hyperparameter e.g. length of longest sentence) and outputs a list of that same fixed size (so one output for each word)
      - can easily train with a masked word to predict the word at the predicted position in the encoding
  - multi-headed attention has several of each of these (then just concat them)
