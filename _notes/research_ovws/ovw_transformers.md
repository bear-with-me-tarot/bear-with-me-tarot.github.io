**pre-transformer nlp models**

- rnns
  - when training rnn, accumulate gradients over sequence and then update all at once
  - **stacked rnns** have outputs of rnns feed into another rnn
  - bidirectional rnn - one rnn left to right and another right to left (can concatenate, add, etc.)
- standard seq2seq
  - encoder reads input and outputs context vector (the hidden state)
  - decoder (rnn) takes this context vector and generates a sequence

##  adaptation / transfer

*These are transformer-specific. For more general notes, see [üìå transfer learning](https://csinva.io/notes/research_ovws/ovw_transfer_learning.html) or [üìå uncertainty](https://csinva.io/notes/research_ovws/ovw_transfer_learning.html).* Most of these approaches can be combined with metalearning.

- finetuning
  - finetune all DNN params
  - finetune linear layer on activations
    - standard - train linear model on the embedding of the first token (usually an added `[CLS]` token) [peters et al. 2018](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1202/)
    - finetune linear model on all the activations
      - e.g. [evci, et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03529) - learn linear layer (using group-lasso) on features extracted from all layers

## transformer circuits / reverse-engineering / editing

**[thread](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) (elhage...olah, 2021)**

- all layers are same dimension and each attention block **adds** a vector to it
- Although they‚Äôre parameterized as separate matrices, $W_O W_V$ and $W_Q^T W_K$ can always be thought of as individual, low-rank matrices
  - $x \in \mathbb R^{d_{embed} \times d_{sequence}}$: $d_{embed}$ can be hundreds - tens of thousands 
  - $W_Q, W_K, W_V \in \mathbb R^{d_{attn} \times d_{embed}}$
    - $W_Q^TW_k \in \mathbb R ^{d_{embed} \times d_{embed}}$
  - $W_O \in \mathbb R^{d_{embed} \times d_{attn}}$: projects attention values back to embedding dimention
    - $W_O W_V \in \mathbb R ^{d_{embed} \times d_{embed}}$
  - $W_E \in \mathbb R^{d_{embed} \times d_{vocab}}$ embeds initial tokens and $W_U \in \mathbb R^{d_{vocab} \times d_{embed}}$ undoes the embedding
    - $d_{vocab}$ can be very large, e.g. 50k
  - $A = \text{softmax}(x^TW_Q^TW_kx) \in \mathbb R^{d_{sequence} \times d_{sequence}}$
- if we have a 0-layer net (e.g. predict next token with linear layer given current token), we just learn bigram log-likelihood
- 2 circuits
  - QK circuit determines which "source" token the present "destination" token attends back to and copies information from
    - $W_{E}^{T} W_{Q}^{T} W_{K} W_{E} \in \mathbb R ^{d_{vocab} \times d_{vocab}}$
  - OV circuit describes what the resulting effect on the "out" predictions for the next token is
    - $W_{U} W_{O} W_{V} W_{E} \in \mathbb R ^{d_{vocab} \times d_{vocab}}$
- if a single head increases the probability of both `keep‚Ä¶ in mind` and `keep‚Ä¶ at bay`, it *must* also increase the probability of `keep‚Ä¶ in bay` and `keep‚Ä¶ at mind`
- **induction heads** search previous examples of present token
  - If they don't find it, they attend to the first token and do nothing
  - if they do find it, they then look at the *next* token and copy it. This allows them to repeat previous sequences of tokens, both exactly and approximately
  - sometimes can do some kind of "fuzzy" matching
- tensor/kronecker product $\bigotimes$:
  - Left-right multiplying: Multiplying $x$ by a tensor product $A \otimes W$ is equivalent to simultaneously left and right multiplying: $(A \otimes W) x=A x W^{T}$
  - When we add them, it is equivalent to adding the results of this multiplication: $\left(A_{1} \otimes W_{1}+A_{2} \otimes W_{2}\right) x=A_{1} x W_{1}^{T}+A_{2} x W_{2}^{T}$ 

**[Softmax Linear Units](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html)**

- replacing activation function with softmax linear unit increases fraction of MLP neurons which are "interpretable", i.e. correspond to meaningful features
  - however, may ‚Äúhide‚Äù some non-neuron-aligned features by decreasing their magnitude and then later recovering it with LayerNorm
- the presence of nonlinear activation functions createse an incentive for features to align with this basis and not get superposed
  - if the gains to sparse coding are large enough, this incentive will get overwhelmed
- ways to combat polysemanticity
  - activation sparsity
  - lateral inhibition / co-occurrence sparsity
  - weight sparsity
  - superlinear activation functions
  - increase neurons per param
- $\text{SoLU}(x) = x \cdot \text{softmax}(x)$
  - adds lateral inhibition, superlinearity, approximate sparsity
  - changes GeLU, which is approximately $\text{sigmoid}(1.7x) \cdot x$
  - just changing to SoLU decrease performance, had to add LayerNorm afterwards

# basics

- **attention** = vector of importance weights
  - to predict or infer one element, such as a pixel in an image or a word in a sentence, we estimate using the attention vector how strongly it is correlated with (or ‚Äú*attends to*‚Äù other elements and take the sum of their values weighted by the attention vector as the approximation of the target
- vanilla transformer: multihead attention, add + norm, position-wise ffn, add + norm
- self-attention layer [implementation](https://github.com/mertensu/transformer-tutorial) and [mathematics](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/docs/transformers.pdf)

## mathematical overview of transformers ([Formal Algorithms for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email))

- tasks
  - *sequence modeling*: learn $p(x)$, usually factorized as $p(x_i|x_1,...,x_{i-1})$
  - *sequence-to-sequence*: learn $p(z|x)$, e.g. transalation, speech-to-text, question answering
- preprocessing
  - embedding matrix takes in one-hot tokens and linearly maps them to a vector
  - positional embedding of a token is usually added to the token embedding to form a token‚Äôs initial embedding
- attention types
  - *Bidirectional / unmasked self-attention* - primary/context vectors are the same
  - *Unidirectional / masked self-attention* - mask scores from before a given word
  - *Cross-attention* - primary/context vectors can come from different places
- non-attention
  - layernorm: controls mean/variance of activations
    - RMSnorm: simpler version, sets mean/offset to zero
- unembedding
  - linear layer (with softmax) that outputs size of original vocab
    - sometimes fixed to be transpose of the embedding matrix
- predictions
  - predict next word using single linear layer on hidden state from previous word
  - finetune classification head often only using linear layer on first token from sequence

- architectures
  - initially, encoder-decoder was common, but now often no decoder

## visual explanation (notes on article by jay allamar)

- **self-attention ** - layer that lets word learn its relation to other layers
  - for each word, want score telling how much importance to place on each other word (queries $\cdot$ keys)
  - we get an encoding for each word
    - the encoding of each word returns a weighted sum of the values of the words (the current word gets the highest weight)
    - softmax this and use it to do weighted sum of values![Screen Shot 2019-08-17 at 2.51.53 PM](../assets/attention.png)
  - (optional) implementation details
    - **multi-headed attention** - just like having many filters, get many encodings for each word
      - each one can take input as the embedding from the previous attention layer
    - **position vector** - add this into the embedding of each word (so words know how far apart they are) - usually use sin/cos rather than actual position number
    - **padding mask** - add zeros to the end of the sequence
    - **look-ahead mask** - might want to mask to only use previous words (e.g. if our final task is decoding)
    - **residual + normalize** - after self-attention layer, often have residual connection to previous input, which gets added then normalized
  - decoder - each word only allowed to attend to previous positions
  - 3 components
    - queries
    - keys
    - values
- **attention**
  - encoder reads input and ouputs context vector after each word
  - decoder at each step uses a different weighted combination of these context vectors
    - specifically, at each step, decoder concatenates its hidden state w/ the attention vector (the weighted combination of the context vectors)
    - this is fed to a feedforward net to output a word
    - ![Screen Shot 2019-04-11 at 7.57.14 PM](../assets/nmt.png)
  - at a high level we have $Q, K, V$ and compute $softmax(QK^T)V$
    - instead could simplify it and do $softmax(XX^T)V$ - this would then be based on kernel
- **transformer**
  - uses many self-attention layers
  - many stacked layers in encoder + decoder (not rnn: self-attention + feed forward)
  - details
    - initial encoding: each word -> vector
    - each layer takes a list of fixed size (hyperparameter e.g. length of longest sentence) and outputs a list of that same fixed size (so one output for each word)
      - can easily train with a masked word to predict the word at the predicted position in the encoding
  - multi-headed attention has several of each of these (then just concat them)

## huggingface tutorial

Broadly, models can be grouped into three categories:

- GPT-like (also called *auto-regressive* Transformer models)
- BERT-like (also called *auto-encoding* Transformer models)
- BART/T5-like (also called *sequence-to-sequence* Transformer models)
- [Handling multiple sequences - Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter2/5?fw=pt)
  - pad sequences to have the same length (need to modify attention masks to ignore the padded values)
