# misc fun

- [winner's curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner%27s_curse) - a phenomenon that may occur in [common value auctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_value_auction), where all bidders have the same (*[ex post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post)*) value for an item but receive different private (*[ex ante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex-ante)*) signals about this value and wherein the winner is the bidder with the most optimistic evaluation of the asset and therefore will tend to overestimate and overpay

  - SEC shut down Hertz selling shares after bankruptcy (stocks would become worthless)

# ml in stock market

- [Uncertainty-Aware Lookahead Factor Models for Quantitative Investing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04082) (chauhan, alberg, & lipton 2020)
  - *fundamentals* - publicly traded companies report these periodically, e.g. revenue, earnings, debt, among others
    - fundamentals forecasting - use LSTM to forecast fundamentals
      - use model uncertainty to avert risk (scale the earnings forecast in inverse proportion to the modeled earnings variance)
      - main fundamental to forecast is *EBIT*, but also forecast others for multi-task benefit
      - given past januaries, predict next january
  - *factors* - functions of the reported data that correlate with stock market performance
    - stock selection part - given future fundamentals, can select stocks better than human-selected factors
  - *value investing* - base investment on long-term fundamentals
    - in this case, rank all stocks acording to factor and invest equal amounts into top 50, re-balancing monthly
  - final improvement: compound annualized return of 17.7% vs 14.0% (standard factor model), CV on held-out stocks, test on held-out time period
    - previous works have been limited to few stocks / short time periods
  - uncertainty
    - data uncertainty (aleatoric): DNN predicts mean + var as separate outputs
      - both are used to calculate loss
    - model uncertainty (epistemic): use MC dropout w/ 10 reps

# quant finance

**based on book by mazzoni**

## basic background

* *Wiener*-process = *Brownian* motion: $W_t$
  * $W_0=0$
  * $W_t$ has independent increments (i.e. is Markov process)
  * $W_t - W_s \sim N(0, t-s)$ for $0 \leq s < t$
  * this implies $f(w)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi(t-s)}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \frac{w^{2}}{t-s}}$
* can use fourier analysis to easily compute things about sums of random variables



## utility theory: see notes in [decisions](https://csinva.io/notes/ai/decisions.html)

- economic theory assumes agents maximix their personal utility, aims to provide framework for rational behavior



## architecture of financial markets

- *arrow-debreu* problem (1954): maximize expected utility under wealth constraint
  - must assume utility function
  - lets us derive marginal rate of substitution MRS: tradeoff in utility between consumption today and consumption in the future
- *portfolio selection problem*
  - payoff matrix $X$ is a $N x P$ matrix, with $P$ securities, each which takes on $N$ possible values and we ewant to find a vector $\theta \in \mathbb R^P$ that maximizes payoff subject to constraint

## markowitz portfolio theory

- everything is embedded in Gaussian distributions
  - assume in short term that different returns are independent (then their sums are normal)
- focuses on mean and variance of return distr. of risky assets over intermediate / long-term horizons

## capital asset pricing model (CAPM) + arbitrage pricing theory (APT)

- CAPM - used to determine theoretical rate of return of an asset
  - $E\left(R_{i}\right)=R_{f}+\beta_{i}\left(E\left(R_{m}\right)-R_{f}\right)
    $
    - $E\left(R_{i}\right)$ is the expected return on the capital asset
    - $R_{f}$ is the risk-free rate of interest such as interest arising from government bonds
    - $\beta_{i}$ is the sensitivity of the expected excess asset returns to the expected excess market returns, or also $\beta_{i}=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}\left(R_{i}, R_{m}\right)}{\operatorname{Var}\left(R_{m}\right)}=\rho_{i, m} \frac{\sigma_{i}}{\sigma_{m}}$
      - $\rho_{i, m}$ denotes the correlation coefficient between the investment $i$ and the market $m$
      - $\sigma_{i}$ is the standard deviation for the investment $i$
      - $\sigma_{m}$ is the standard deviation for the market $m$.
    - $E\left(R_{m}\right)$ is the expected return of the market
    - overly simple
  
- APT - expected return is a linear function of various factors 
	- $ \mathbb{E}\left(r_{j}\right)=r_{f}+\lambda_{j 1} R P_{1}+\lambda_{j 2} R P_{2}+\cdots+\lambda_{j n} R P_{n}$
	  - $R P_{n}$ is the risk premium of the factor,
    - $r_{f}$ is the risk-free rate,
    - $ r_{j}=a_{j}+\lambda_{j 1} f_{1}+\lambda_{j 2} f_{2}+\cdots+\lambda_{j n} f_{n}+\epsilon_{j}$
      where
      $a_{j}$ is a constant for asset $j$
      $ f_{n}$ is a systematic factor
      $\lambda_{j n}$ is the sensitivity of the $j$ th asset to factor $n,$ also called factor loading,
    - and $\epsilon_{j}$ is the risky asset's idiosyncratic random shock with mean zero.I diosyncratic shocks are assumed to be uncorrelated across assets and uncorrelated with the factors.
  
  - **Arbitrage** = practice of taking positive expected return from overvalued or undervalued securities in the inefficient market without any incremental risk and zero additional investments.



## portfolio performance and management

- measure of portfolio performance
  - **Sharpe ratio** $S_a = \frac{\mathbb E [R_a - R_b]}{\sigma_a}$: performance compared to a risk-free asset, adjusted for risk
    - $R_a$ is asset return
    - $R_b$ is risk-free benchmark return (e.g. U.S. Treasury security)
    - $\sigma_a$ is the stddev of the excess return
- management
  - what proportion should be invested in risky part of portfolio?
  - Kelly criterion - very good formula for bet sizing in long-term



## financial economics

- explains how markets and prices of risky investments evolve



## behavioral finance

- deviates from utility theory by factoring in psychological considerations and  deviations from rationality



## forwards, futures, and options

- derivatives are contracts whose value depends on the value of other securities, commodities, rates, or derivatives
- **forwards** - over-the-counter, settlement is at expiry or shortly after
- **futures** - standardized contract traded in an organized markets
  - need to account for change in price over time (e.g. interest)
- **options**
  - gives you option to buy a stock, but bounds losses
  - call is analog of long (normal buying)
  - put is analog of short
  - ![what-are-call-options](../assets/what-are-call-options.gif)
- compound positions
  - ![compound_positions](../assets/compound_positions.png)
  - ![bull_bear_spread](../assets/bull_bear_spread.png)
  - **protective put buying** - limits dowside risk of a security/portfolio
  - **covered call writing** - 



### binomial (CRR) model

- Cox-Ross-Rubeinstein model (CRR)
  - simplification of brevious black-scholes model (1973)
- numerical method for valuation of options
- simulates discrete-time model of the varying price over time



### black-scholes theory

- PDE for evolution of derivatives
- can derive closed-form

### volatility (deterministic / stochastic)



## processes with jumps



## basic fixed-income instruments

- fixed-income instruments don't have the option to have a risk-free asset as san alternative (e.g. putting money in a bank)

### plain fixed-income derivatives



## term structure models



## LIBOR market model



# private equity

*[Private Equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp#:~:text=Private%20equity%20is%20an%20alternative,the%20delisting%20of%20public%20equity.) is an alternative investment class of capital for things not on public exchange (e.g. private companies, or buyouts of public companies). Can be nicer for entrepeneurs*  

- private equity firms make money by charging management and performance fees from investors in a fund
  - like a hedge fund, managing partners take basic fees + profit percentage
  - differs in that private equity invests directly in companies or buys a controlling interest (usually more long-term, lower risk)
- types
  - **venture capital** is a type of private equity
  - leveraged buyouts - most popular  - buy company to improve it then resell it (to individual or in IPO)
  - distressed funding - money given to struggling company to turn it around

# bullshit jobs (by david graeber)

- "In the year 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by century's end, technology would have adavanced sufficiently that counties like the US would have achieved a fifteen-hour work week"
- "layoffs and speed-ups invariably fall on that class of people who are actually making, moving, fixing, and maintaining things"
- "If 1 percent of the population controls most of the displosable wealth, what we call "the market" reflects what they think is useful or important"
- defining bullshit jobs
  - "what would happen were this entire class of people to simply disappear?"
  - survey question: "does your job 'make a meaningful contribution to the world'? Astonishingly, more than a third--37 percent--said they believed that it did not"
  - "a bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case"
- bullshit jobs categorization
  - flunkies - exist only or primarily to make someone else look or feel important
    - e.g. unneeded doorman, receptionist, administrative assistants
    - higher-ups' importance will almost invariably be measured by total num employees working upder them
  - goons - people whose jobs have an aggressive element but exist only bc other people employ them
    - if no one had an army, armies would not be needed: same for lobbyists, PR specialists, telemarketers, corporate lawyers
  - duct tapers - jobs exist only bc of a fault in the organization - solve a problem which shouldn't exist
    - ex. software dev for internal unused software
  - box tickers - allow an organization to claim it is doing something it is not
    - ex. fact-finding commision, gov. bureaucracy, making nice-looking reports
  - taskmasters
    - type 1 - assign work to others
    - type 2 - create fake tasks for others to do
    - managerialist ideologies in complex organizations require staff to keep the managerialist plates spinning
- misc
  - one ex. "this is all just greed propped up by inflated prices of necessities"
  - "most people who do a great deal of harm in the world are protected against the knowledge that they do so"
  - at least in the traditional workplace, there was someone against whom you could direct your rage
  - like Olympic endurance boredom for its own sake
- psychology
  - when in a bullshit job, hard not to feel you're being pressured/manipulated, with the added indignity that you're also betraying the trust of someone whose side you should be on
    - people who win lotteries rarely quit their jobs, and if they do regret it
    - in priosns where inmates are not required to work, denying them work is often used as punishment
  - childeren learn largely by understanding they can cause things to happen
    - when causality is taken away in simple experiments, children become very upset
    - schiller argued that the desire to create art is simply a manifestation of the urge to play as the exercise of freedom for its own sake as well
  - **scriptlessness** - like guilt - people who had unrequited love during adolescence usually got overt it, but people who were the object of unrequited love often didn't
- moral logic
  - idleness is not dangerous - idleness is theft
  - **in places without clocks, time is measured by actions rather than action being measured by time**
  - The Nuer have no expression equivalent to "time" in our language, and they cannot speak of time as though it were something actual
  - the discipline of economics itself emerged out of moral philosophy (Adam Smith was a professor of moral philisophy) + moral philosophy came from theology
- politics
  - "The main political reaction to our awareness that half the time we are engaged in utterly meaningless or even counterproductive activities--usually under the orders of a person we dislike--is to rankle with resentment over the fact there might be others out there who are not in the same trap"
    - "as a result, hatred resentment, and suspicion have become the glue that holds society together"
  - **rights-scolding**
    - right-wing: criticize others for thinking the world owes them a living, medical treatment, maternity leave
    - left-wing: check your privilege
  - frightening monsters in popular do not simply threaten to hurt you but to turn you into a monster yourself (e.g. vampire, zombie)
  - the joke under the soviet union was "we pretend to work; they pretend to pay us"
  - "Puratinanism: the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy. -- H.L. Menchken"
