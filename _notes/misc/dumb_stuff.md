There was a tomato
 and he was in quite a pickle,
 he couldn't decide
 whether he was fruit or vegetable.

Then one sunny day,
 a pickle said to him
 "Come now fair tomato there's no need to be grim."

The tomato blushed red like a baked red potato "But I don't really know how to be a tomato."

The tomato was confused, he didn't understand.
 Life was playing hot-potato with him in its hands.

"I simply can't decide what type I want to be, fruit or vegetable
 is the choice up to me?"

And that's when the tomato finally seized the day
 he decided to catch-up
 and make things okay.

"I am a tomato and that's all that I am. Not vegetable not fruit not dairy not ham!"

So if you're a tomato,
 don't feel so dejected tomatoes are tomatoes
 they just want to be accepted.
