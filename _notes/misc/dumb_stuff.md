There was a tomato<br>
and he was in quite a pickle,<br>
he couldn't decide<br>
whether he was fruit or vegetable.<br>

Then one sunny day,<br>
a pickle said to him<br>
"Come now fair tomato<br>
there's no need to be grim."<br>

The tomato blushed red<br>
like a baked red potato<br>
"But I don't really know<br>
how to be a tomato."<br>

The tomato was confused,<br>
he didn't understand.<br>
Life was playing hot-potato<br>
with him in its hands.<br>

"I simply can't decide<br>
what type I want to be,<br>
fruit or vegetable<br>
is the choice up to me?"<br>

And that's when the tomato<br>
finally seized the day<br>
he decided to catch-up<br>
and make things okay.<br>

"I am a tomato<br>
and that's all that I am.<br>
Not vegetable not fruit<br>
not dairy not ham!"<br>

So if you're a tomato,<br>
don't feel so dejected<br>
tomatoes are tomatoes<br>
they just want to be accepted.<br>
